# Documentation Updates Summary

This document summarizes the improvements made to the Peppi documentation to address [Issue #113](https://github.com/NASA-PDS/peppi/issues/113).

## Problem Statement

The original documentation was too technical and developer-focused, making it difficult for:
- Non-Python experts to get started
- Researchers who understand PDS but not Python APIs
- Users to discover available methods and features
- New users to accomplish common tasks

## Solution Overview

Reorganized and expanded the documentation into a four-tiered structure:

1. **Getting Started** - Beginner-friendly introduction
2. **User Guide** - Comprehensive conceptual explanations
3. **Cookbook** - 20 ready-to-use recipes organized by skill level
4. **Reference** - Auto-generated API documentation (unchanged)

## New Files Created

### 1. `docs/source/getting_started.rst`

**Purpose:** Gentle introduction for users new to Python or Peppi

**Key Features:**
- Explains what Peppi is in plain language
- Step-by-step installation instructions
- Walks through first search with explanations of each line
- Troubleshooting common installation issues
- Clear next steps directing users to other documentation

**Target Audience:** Complete beginners, students, non-programmers

### 2. `docs/source/user_guide.rst`

**Purpose:** Comprehensive conceptual documentation

**Key Sections:**
- **Key Concepts** - PDS products, identifiers, data organization
- **Core Components** - PDSRegistryClient, Products, Context explained in detail
- **Building Queries** - Query builder pattern, lazy evaluation, pagination
- **Available Filters** - Complete list with examples (by target, time, mission, etc.)
- **Working with Results** - Iterating, DataFrames, metadata access
- **Combining Filters** - Complex multi-criteria queries
- **Tips and Best Practices** - How to explore data effectively
- **Common Metadata Fields** - Reference table of useful PDS4 properties

**Target Audience:** All users who want to understand how Peppi works

### 3. `docs/source/cookbook.rst`

**Purpose:** Practical, copy-paste examples organized by skill level

**Structure:**

**Getting Started Recipes (6 recipes):**
1. Find all data about a specific target
2. Search by mission/spacecraft
3. Find data from a specific time period
4. Get calibrated data only
5. Export results to CSV
6. Browse available targets

**Intermediate Recipes (6 recipes):**
7. Find mission-specific data in a date range
8. Compare data from multiple processing levels
9. Find data and get DOI for citation
10. Search for collections, then get their products
11. Filter results by title keyword
12. Extract specific metadata fields only

**Advanced Recipes (8 recipes):**
13. Compare data coverage across multiple targets
14. Build a data timeline
15. Find overlapping observations
16. Create a custom data report
17. Work with OSIRIS-REx specialized products
18. Handle large result sets efficiently
19. Fuzzy search across multiple terms
20. Build a reusable search function

**Features:**
- Each recipe has a clear goal statement
- Complete, runnable code examples
- Suggestions for variations to try
- Explanatory comments throughout

**Target Audience:** Users at all levels looking for specific solutions

## Modified Files

### 1. `docs/source/index.rst`

**Changes:**
- Added "Quick Example" section on homepage
- Added "Key Features" highlighting what makes Peppi useful
- Added "Who is Peppi For?" explaining use cases for different audiences
- Added "Documentation Structure" helping users choose where to start
- Reorganized table of contents with clear sections
- Added "Additional Resources" linking to related projects
- Improved "Contributing" section with specific links

**Impact:** Homepage is now welcoming and helps users navigate to the right resource

### 2. `docs/source/quickstart.rst`

**Changes:**
- Added note at top directing to new guides
- Enhanced "Next Steps" section with links to new documentation
- Updated "Additional Resources" section

**Impact:** Existing quickstart page now acts as a bridge to the expanded docs

## Key Improvements Addressing Issue #113

1. **"Unusable from a new user perspective"**
   - ✅ Created beginner-friendly `getting_started.rst` with step-by-step explanations
   - ✅ Used plain language throughout instead of technical jargon
   - ✅ Included explanations of what each line of code does

2. **"Auto-generated documentation is gibberish"**
   - ✅ Created conceptual `user_guide.rst` explaining how everything works
   - ✅ Added examples throughout showing practical usage
   - ✅ Kept API reference but made it just one part of larger documentation

3. **"Not clear what methods I can use"**
   - ✅ User guide has complete "Available Filters" section listing all methods
   - ✅ Cookbook shows methods in context of real use cases
   - ✅ Each method explained with purpose and examples

4. **"Need recipes for simple things"**
   - ✅ Created cookbook with 20 recipes organized by skill level
   - ✅ Each recipe is self-contained and ready to copy
   - ✅ Covers common tasks like searching, filtering, exporting

5. **"Very developer focused"**
   - ✅ Getting started guide assumes minimal Python knowledge
   - ✅ Explains concepts from a user perspective, not implementation
   - ✅ Uses domain language (targets, missions, data) instead of technical terms

## Building the Documentation

The documentation builds successfully with Sphinx:

```bash
sphinx-build -b html docs/source docs/build
```

All warnings are related to missing `rapidfuzz` dependency in the build environment, which will resolve in proper CI/CD builds.

## Content Statistics

- **Getting Started**: ~450 lines, covers installation through first successful search
- **User Guide**: ~600 lines, comprehensive reference for all concepts and features
- **Cookbook**: ~1000 lines with 20 complete, tested code examples
- **Total new content**: ~2050 lines of documentation

## Recommendations for Future Improvements

1. **Add Screenshots**: Include images of output for visual learners
2. **Video Tutorials**: Create screen recordings of common workflows
3. **Interactive Examples**: Consider Jupyter notebooks or Binder integration
4. **Translations**: Consider translating docs for international users
5. **User Testing**: Get feedback from actual new users on documentation clarity
6. **Mission-Specific Guides**: Create focused guides for popular missions (MSL, Perseverance, etc.)
7. **Data Download Examples**: Add recipes showing how to download actual data files
8. **Visualization Examples**: Show how to visualize/plot PDS data

## Next Steps

1. Review the new documentation with team members
2. Test examples with actual users
3. Build docs in CI/CD to verify full API reference generation
4. Update any broken links or references
5. Consider adding Jupyter notebook versions of cookbook recipes
6. Solicit community contributions for additional recipes
