PDS Peppi
=========

The Planetary Data System (PDS_) Peppi Service provides a Python library for
interfacing with the PDS Registry API via the API Client (API_). Peppi can be
used to query the PDS Registry for data products using a number of filtering
mechanisms to retrieve information for specific PDS Bundles, Collections, etc.
