# Peppi

Access planetary datasets from the Planetary Data System (PDS)


## Prerequisites

- Python 3.13 or newer


## User Quickstart

Install with:

    pip install pds.peppi


## Code of Conduct

All users and developers of the NASA-PDS software are expected to abide by our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/NASA-PDS/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Please read this to ensure you understand the expectations of our community.


## Development

To develop this project, use your favorite text editor, or an integrated development environment with Python support, such as [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/).


### Contributing

For information on how to contribute to NASA-PDS codebases please take a look at our [Contributing guidelines](https://github.com/NASA-PDS/.github/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).


### Installation

Install in editable mode and with extra developer dependencies into your virtual environment of choice:

    pip install git+https://github.com/NASA-AMMOS/slim-detect-secrets.git@exp
    pip install --editable '.[dev]'

Then, configure the `pre-commit` hooks:

    pre-commit install
    pre-commit install -t pre-push
    pre-commit install -t prepare-commit-msg
    pre-commit install -t commit-msg

These hooks then will check for any future commits that might contain secrets. They also check code formatting, PEP8 compliance, type hints, etc.

ðŸ‘‰ **Note:** A one time setup is required both to support `detect-secerts` and in your global Git configuration. See [the wiki entry on Secrets](https://github.com/NASA-PDS/nasa-pds.github.io/wiki/Git-and-Github-Guide#detect-secrets) to learn how.


### Tests

This section describes testing for your package.

A complete "build" including test execution, linting (`mypy`, `black`, `flake8`, etc.), and documentation build is executed via:

    tox


## Build

    pip install build
    python3 -m build .


## Publication

NASA PDS packages can publish automatically using the [Roundup Action](https://github.com/NASA-PDS/roundup-action), which leverages GitHub Actions to perform automated continuous integration and continuous delivery. A default workflow that includes the Roundup is provided in the `.github/workflows/unstable-cicd.yaml` file. (Unstable here means an interim release.)


### Manual Publication

Create the package:

    python3 -m build .

Publish it as a Github release.

Publish on PyPI (you need a PyPI account and configure `$HOME/.pypirc`):

    pip install twine
    twine upload dist/*

Or publish on the Test PyPI (you need a Test PyPI account and configure `$HOME/.pypirc`):

    pip install twine
    twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*
